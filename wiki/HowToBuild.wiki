= Introduction =

This page contains the instruction on how to build [http://hoxchess.googlecode.com/ HOXChess] based on the _latest_ version of the source code.
The page's content is based entirely on my experience working on the project.

= Requirements =
Starting from version _0.0.2.0_ (released on Nov 10, 2007), the project can be built under Windows and Linux, thanks to the cross platform portability of [http://www.wxwidgets.org wxWidgets].

  * [http://www.wxwidgets.org/ wxWidgets] 2.9.0 (the not-yet-released *trunk* version)
    * I tested [http://wxwindows.sourceforge.net/snapshots/ the daily builds] on Feb 14, 2009
    * Note for Ubuntu: 
      * Use *wxGTK*
      * To build, simply follow the instruction of _readme-gtk.txt_ of the downloaded *wxGTK-YYYY-MM-DD.tar.gz* to build wxGTK:
  * [http://www.boost.org Boost C++ 1_36_0 Libraries] Headers only. Already included in the source code 
  * Operating Systems
    * Under Windows
      * Windows XP or Vista
      * Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition
    * Under Linux
      * Any Linux distribution that supports _g++_ and _make_ packages. I have tried on the following:
        * [http://www.centos.org/ CentOS] 4.7 using [http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/ Eclipse CDT] 4.0.1, or
        * [http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu] 8.10 using [http://www.kdevelop.org KDevelop] 3.5 (as a _custom Makefile_ project or as an _Automake_ based project).

= Detailed Instructions under Windows =
  * wxWidgets: Put the libraries and headers under _C:\wxMSW-2.9.0_
    * If your wxWidgets' location is different, then you need to adjust the appropriate settings of _hox_Client.vcproj_.
  * Open the project *hox_Client* under the solution _hox_Project/hox_Project.sln_ inside Visual Studio C++ and build from there.

= Detailed Instructions under Linux =
  * $ cd _.../CChess/hox_Project/hox_Client_
  * $ *make prepare*
  * $ *make*
    * Everything is contained within one simple _Makefile_ located under _CChess/hox_Project/hox_Client_
      * Once the _hoxchess_ executable file is built, run it as follows:
        * LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/wxWidgets/libs ./hoxchess
          * For example: LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/wxGTK-2.9.0/lib ./hoxchess
  * *Note* : 
    * For those who develop in [http://www.kdevelop.org KDevelop], I also created an KDevelop project _CChess/hox_Project/hox_Project.kdevelop_
    * This project file is simply a wrapper of the _Makefile_ mentioned above.

= Detailed Instructions under Eclipse in Linux =
  * For [http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/ Eclipse C++ (CDT)], the project files (_.project_ and _.cproject_) have been included under _/hox_Project_ folder in the .zip archive since version _0.1.0.0_
  * If you ever need to create a new project yourself, here is the summary of the steps:
    * Add all the source code (.h and .cpp) files to the your new project.
    * Adjust the Eclipse' s C++ compiler's setting (such as _--cppflags_ and _--libs_) based on the output of wxWidgets' s *wx-config* program.
  * *Note* : 
    * So far, I can only manage to install Eclipse CDT 4.0.1 on my CentOS 4.5 based desktop.
      * I have _not_ been able to do the same on my Ubuntu 7.10 based laptop.

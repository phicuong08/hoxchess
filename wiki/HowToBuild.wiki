= Introduction =

This page contains the instruction on how to build [http://hoxchess.googlecode.com/ HOXChess] based on the _latest_ version of the source code.
The page's content is based entirely on my experience working on the project.

= Requirements =
Starting from version _0.7.5.0_ (released on Jun 09, 2009), the project can be built under Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X thanks to the cross platform portability of [http://www.wxwidgets.org wxWidgets].

  * [http://www.wxwidgets.org/ wxWidgets] 2.9.0 (the not-yet-released *branch* version)
    * I tested the 2.9.0 branch on Jun 06, 2009
    * For Ubuntu, we need the *wxGTK* port.
  * [http://www.boost.org Boost C++ 1_38_0 Libraries] Headers only. Already included in the source code 
  * [http://www.think-async.com/Asio/WebHome Asio 1.4.1 C++ Library] Headers only. Already included in the source code 
  * Operating Systems
    * Under Windows
      * Windows XP or Vista
      * Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition
    * Under Linux
      * Any Linux distribution that supports _g++_ and _make_ packages. I have tried on the following:
        * [http://www.centos.org/ CentOS] 4.7 and 5.3, or
        * [http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu] 9.04
    * Under Mac OS X using *Xcode*

= Detailed Instructions under Windows =
  * wxWidgets: Put the libraries and headers under _C:\wxMSW-2.9.0_
    * If your wxWidgets' location is different, then you need to adjust the appropriate settings of _hox_Client.vcproj_.
  * Open the project *hox_Client* under the solution _hox_Project/hox_Project.sln_ inside Visual Studio C++ and build from there.

= Detailed Instructions under Linux =
  * Follow [wxWidgetsInHOXChess the instructions here] to build *wxGTK* libraries
  * Build AI Engine Plugins and the main _hoxchess_ executable as follows:
{{{
  $ cd .../hox_Project/plugins/
  $ ./run.sh
  $ cd .../hox_Project/hox_Client/
  $ make
  $ ./hoxchess
}}}

= Detailed Instructions under Eclipse in Linux =
  * For [http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/ Eclipse C++ (CDT)], the project files (_.project_ and _.cproject_) have been included under _/hox_Project_ folder in the .zip archive since version _0.1.0.0_
  * If you ever need to create a new project yourself, here is the summary of the steps:
    * Add all the source code (.h and .cpp) files to the your new project.
    * Adjust the Eclipse' s C++ compiler's setting (such as _--cppflags_ and _--libs_) based on the output of wxWidgets' s *wx-config* program.

= Detailed Instructions under Xcode in Mac OS X 10.5 =
  * Follow [wxWidgetsInHOXChess the instructions here] to build *wxMac* libraries
{{{
  $ make build-release
  $ cd build-release
  $ ../configure –prefix=/opt/wxWidgets-2.9.0 –disable-compat28 –without-libtiff –disable-shared
  $ make
  $ sudo make install
}}}
  * Then, simply open the *Xcode* project under _.../hox_Project/HOXChess.xcodeproj_ and build

= Introduction =

This page describes how to build [http://www.wxwidgets.org/ wxWidgets] (and wxGTK) libraries to be used by HOXChess.
Starting from version _0.6.0.0_, HOXChess needs on the _not-yet-released_ *trunk* version *wxWidgets-2.9.0* of wxWidgets in order to handle Unicode characters (in Chinese, Vietnamese, etc).
The daily builds of wxWidgets [http://wxwindows.sourceforge.net/snapshots/ can be downloaded here]

= Instructions under Linux =

This following procedure has been test under *Ubuntu 8.10* (64-bit).
I use the *wxGTK* port of wxWidgets.
The latest snapshot trunk version that has been tested is *wxWidgets.tar_2009_03_29.bz2*

  * Required packages before building wxWidgets 2.9.0
    * $ sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev
    * $ sudo apt-get install libtiff4-dev
  * Download a daily source archive from:
    * http://wxwindows.sourceforge.net/snapshots/
    * Note: I put a working copy of wxGTK [http://www.playxiangqi.com/cchess/libs/ on my server here].
  * Unpack the archived file
  * Follow instructions in _wxGTK/readme-gtk.txt_. Here are the steps I use:
{{{
    $ mkdir build_gtk
    $ cd build_gtk
    $ ../configure --prefix=/opt/wxGTK-2.9.0 --disable-compat28
      # Note: For debug build, add the option [--enable-debug] 
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
}}}
  * In the end, you would have wxGTK under /opt/wxGTK-2.9.0

= Instructions under Windows =

The procedure is much easier under Windows (XP or Vista). Simply locate the _workspace_ (or _solution_) file under *.../build/msw/wx.dsw*, open it under Visual C++ 2008 Express, and build
  * See the other HowToBuild wiki page for more details.
